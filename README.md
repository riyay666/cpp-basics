# cpp-basics
This repository contains my complete learning journey of **C++ programming from scratch**.  
It includes fundamental concepts, syntax practice, and basic problem-solving programs written during my B.Tech CSE coursework and self-study.

The goal of this repository is to build **strong C++ fundamentals** that will later support **DSA, competitive programming, and core software development**.
